    <h1>Sysouphanh Harmon's Resume</h1>
    <h4>25170 Great Berkhamsted Dr. • Aldie, VA 20150 • 703-867-3377 • sysharmon@gmail.com</4>
    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    <p>I am a self-driven, results oriented technology professional with over 10 years in the public and private sector. 
    I have experience in data and applications analysis, database management, open-source intelligence gathering, project management, and Microsoft Windows SharePoint. 
    For the past 10 years, I have been a stay-at-home Mom to raise my son. During that time, I remained active in managing household logistics and finances, volunteering at my church, and taking online courses. 
    Through self-study and determination, I became certified as an AWS Solutions Architect Associate in 2022. During the past two years, I have focused my efforts on increasing my data analytics knowledge by learning Python, SQL, and to a lesser degree, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. </p>
